## Introduction

Potato crops are prone to diseases, which can significantly reduce yield. This project addresses the challenge of identifying diseased leaves from images using machine learning techniques.Potato crops are vulnerable to diseases such as Early Blight (caused by fungi) and Late Blight (caused by microorganisms), which significantly impact crop yield and farmer income. This project uses machine learning techniques to classify potato leaf images as Healthy, Early Blight, or Late Blight
